# WorkshopPRS 2021

The materials are developed by our PRS research team funded by the University of Toronto Mclaughlin Centre. The workshop was first offered in May 2021 locally in Toronto, then presented at the International Genetic Epidemiology Society IGES Educational Workshop in Oct 2021.

For Statistical Fundamentals of PRS, there are six sets of slides, including 
- PRS-intro001-overview: a topic-stratified PRS reference list
- PRS-intro101-foundation: GWAS, h^2 and prediction
- PRS-intro201-basic: PRS calculation and performance evaluation
- PRS-intro301-basic-plus: some obvious or not so obvious follow-up Qs
- PRS-intro401-heterogeneity: heterogeneity and transportabiliy
- PRS-intro501-LD: linkage disequilibrium

001 and 101 slides are posted now, and all .pdf and .Rmd files will be uploaded shortly after the workshop. 

(Other workshop materials will also be released after the workshop.)

For the six sets of slides on Statistical Fundamentals of PRS, although they were presented in two hours, only some of the materials could be covered. Substantial longer time can be spent on each set depending on the educational setting.
